                Flock Party is the platform that lets you play the best conversation games instantly with your friends.
                Party favorites like "Would You Rather...", "Never Would I Ever...", and "Two Truths and a Lie" will
                engage any social gathering with interesting debate while revealing some of your friends most interesting qualities. And after the game,
                learn a bit more about your friends and yourself. Who shares the drive of Lil' Wayne? Could you work alongside
                Sherlock Holmes? Whose mind is most in common with Stewie Griffin? Connect with your friends and find out now!

                Your Flock connects you with others who may share common interests, and provides recommendations on careers,
                programs of study, and even schools. Flock Party's algorithm interprets in-game feedback to match you with only the
                best options for you. Flocks are based on seven values derived from <a href="https://www.onetonline.org/">ONET's</a>
                extensive database, back by the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.
