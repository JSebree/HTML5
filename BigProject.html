<h1 align="left">Student-Career Matching</h1>
<p>For my big project, I will be creating half of a joint website with Khalida Allen. We have begun to build out an idea we had for matching students with potential career paths and education tools. It is a substantial product, so we are only looking to complete the front end piece in this class.</p>
