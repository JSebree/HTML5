<h1 align="left">Web Standards: Are they really necessary?</h1>
    <p>Our technology is a mirror image of our humanity. When examining our distant past, archeologists and anthropologists rely heavily on our predecessors’ technology to draw conclusions on how humans interacted with one another and the world around them. But it wasn’t until the creation of written language that historians were finally able to see into the minds of our ancestors. It was also during this time where we see civilization adopt more complex interactions such as government, religion, and education. But why is this the case?</p><br/>
    <p>It turns out that language, as a tool of connecting one person’s thoughts, ideas, and experiences to the mind of another’s, allowed for technology to thrive and evolve at an exponential rate. Suddenly, we were no longer a single solitary mind, but rather one of millions connected to an ever-expanding super mind.</p><br/>
    <p>Language enabled all of this. But language itself is nothing more than a combination of standards; an agreed upon set of symbols and sounds that are strung together to create a dictionary of words that allow us to transfer subjective experience to others in a more objective way. If language did not have standards, you may not even be able to read the text on this page.</p><br/>
    <p>The new revolutionary technology of today, the World Wide Web, bears a striking resemblance of a language system. Like language did for our ancestors, the web is allowing us to bridge our minds at an exponential rate. But also, like language, there needs to be standards to allow our interactions to be transmitted and interpreted on a mass scale. Or, in other words, standards make coded content (HTML5) accessible to everyone with a decoder (web browsers).</p><br/>
    <p>If I spoke a make-believe language without sharing with you the proper way to decode it, I then should not expect you to understand what I am saying when I speak. Likewise, for developers who do not follow web standards that can be read by web browsers, they should not expect their pages to load and/or render successfully and thereby risk their message not being able to reach their audience</p><br/>
    <p>Like it or not, standards are necessary to enable intended connections between systems. But this doesn’t mean that developers cannot express themselves creatively. Standards have not limited the hundreds of thousands of authors, musicians, public speakers, teachers, and philosophers distribute their ideas to mass audiences. Their creativity comes from how effectively they can use those standards to convey the most compelling of messages.</p>
