    <h2 align="left">About Me</h2>
    <p>I am an aspiring Java developer, currently pursing a Bachelors of Science in Information Technology at the
        <a href="http://www.uml.edu">University of Massachusetts</a>. Prior to enrolling, much of my career has been in
        the financial service industry where I first noticed my knack for efficient systems. To increase productivity
        as a Financial Consultant, I built excel-based programs working with functions and macros before teaching myself
        VBA. I eventually took on projects that involved larger data sets which challenged me to become proficient with
        database tools such as Access, MySQL, and Oracle. The slow transition from financial management to information
        technology has been life altering, encouraging me to dream up and build efficient systems while allowing me to
        express myself creatively. I enrolled into UMass to excelerate my training as a developer and I'm currently
        looking for opportunities to gain <a href="Jerick_C_Sebree_Resume.pdf">experience</a> in this fast-paced field
        that is ushering in a modern day Renaissance.
